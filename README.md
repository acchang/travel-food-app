# TooGoodToBeASurprise
"Build what you like and what interests you," they said. So I built this full-stack app inspired by an app I really enjoy, and speaks to my interests (food) and values (environmental concerns and waste reduction).

ToGoodToGo is an app aimed at reducing food waste by creating a new market for food vendors who would otherwise throw out their product. Think of bakery day-olds, bagels in the evening, or even berries at the close of a farmer's market, or the staples like mashed potatoes or beans and rice a restaurant may have at the end of the night. 

Traditionally, these things have gone in the trash because it made no sense to keep them. People usually want them fresh. 

This app lets people know when food vendors have such excess, and lets people buy it at a significant discount, but without fully identifying what they're selling before hand, in a "surprise bag."

It doesn't always work as intended though. Some vendors put poor products in the bag, or the bag doesn't reach the promised three times the retail value. I thought it would be fun to track what vendors offer what, and sort them by neighborhood or city when people wanted to explore.



## How It's Made

## Special Features

## Optimizations

Right not the likes are unattached to user_id and just increment. I've hidden that feature for now.

I would like to make location changeable.

Once I got the likes right, I could use the data to make a favorites list.

Comments are also in (and hidden). I would like to tie them to user identity.
